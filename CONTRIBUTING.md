## How to Open an Issue

[Create an issue](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-cstg/issues/new/choose) using the appropriate template.

Choose a short, descriptive title. Briefly explain what you think needs changing. Among other things, your suggestions may include grammar or spelling errors, or address insufficient or outdated content.

## How to Submit a Pull Request

Here are the steps for creating and submitting a Pull Request (PR) that we can quickly review and merge.

1. [Set up your environment](#how-to-set-up-your-contributor-environment) to fork the project and install a Markdown linter.
2. Associate your contribution with an [issue](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-cstg/issues). 
3. Make your modifications. Be sure to follow our [style guide](style_guide.md).
4. When you're ready to submit your work, push your changes to your fork. Ensure that your fork is [synced with `master`](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork).
5. You can submit a [draft PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) or a [regular PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). If your work is not yet ready for review and merge, choose a draft PR. When your changes are ready to be reviewed, you can convert to a regular PR. See [how to change the stage of a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) for more.

You may want to [allow edits from maintainers](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so we can help with small changes like fixing typos.

Once you've submitted your ready-for-review PR, we'll review it. We may comment to ask for clarification or changes, so please check back in the next few days.
